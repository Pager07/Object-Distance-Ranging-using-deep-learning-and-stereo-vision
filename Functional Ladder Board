#           - Read image file data 
#           - Get list of all file names  in a sorted manner
#           - for each image
# #             - How to loop through each image?
#               - find disparity image of the image 
#               - get 3D points from proejct_disparity_to_3d() fucntion
#               - for each 3D points, convert it to (x,y)
                        # store a mapping {(x,y):Z}
#               - pass it thorugh yolo
#               - get reults: classID'S, confidences,boxes
#                   - for each detection
                            # - get center coordinates of the box (cx,cy)
                            #      - get z for (cx,cy) key //using int so, the coord must be there     
                            #- edit drawpred() 
                            #       - to show distacne

#     - What yolo premade function do I have?
            # - draw_pred
                # - We dont need to focus on this function for now
            # - post_process
                #  - We dont need to focus on this function for now
            # - getOutputsNames 
                # - net is the cnn that gets the layers name
                # - Where is net defined?
                #     - net is passed in as argument
#    - What output does yolo give out?
#           -use postporcess() function to get classIDs
#               - classIDs,confidences,boxes
#               - boxes: [[obj1]....[objn]]
#                   - obj1:[left,top,wdith,height]
#                           -What is left,top,wdith,height? -> check drawpred
#                                   - left,top : (x,y) of top left coord
